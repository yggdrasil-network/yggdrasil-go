/*
The config package contains structures related to the configuration of an
Yggdrasil node.

The configuration contains, amongst other things, encryption keys which are used
to derive a node's identity, information about peerings and node information
that is shared with the network. There are also some module-specific options
related to TUN, multicast and the admin socket.

In order for a node to maintain the same identity across restarts, you should
persist the configuration onto the filesystem or into some configuration storage
so that the encryption keys (and therefore the node ID) do not change.

Note that Yggdrasil will automatically populate sane defaults for any
configuration option that is not provided.
