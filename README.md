## Introduction

Yggdrasil is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6
network. It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms and
allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with
other Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet
connectivity - it also works over IPv4.

Although Yggdrasil shares many similarities with
[cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns), it employs a different routing
algorithm based on a globally-agreed spanning tree and greedy routing in a
metric space, and aims to implement some novel local backpressure routing
techniques. In theory, Yggdrasil should scale well on networks with
internet-like topologies.

## Supported Platforms

We actively support the following platforms, and packages are available for
some of the below:

- Linux
  - `.deb` and `.rpm` packages are built by CI for Debian and Red Hat-based
    distributions
  - Void and Arch packages also available within their respective repositories
- macOS
  - `.pkg` packages are built by CI
- Ubiquiti EdgeOS
  - `.deb` Vyatta packages are built by CI
- Windows
- FreeBSD
- OpenBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenWrt

Please see our [Platforms](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/) pages for more
specific information about each of our supported platforms, including
installation steps and caveats.

You may also find other platform-specific wrappers, scripts or tools in the
`contrib` folder.

## Building

If you want to build from source, as opposed to installing one of the pre-built
packages:

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org) (requires Go 1.11 or later)
2. Clone this repository
2. Run `./build`

Note that you can cross-compile for other platforms and architectures by
specifying the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables, e.g. `GOOS=windows
./build` or `GOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle ./build`.

## Running

### Generate configuration

To generate static configuration, either generate a HJSON file (human-friendly,
complete with comments):

```
./yggdrasil -genconf > /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

... or generate a plain JSON file (which is easy to manipulate
programmatically):

```
./yggdrasil -genconf -json > /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

You will need to edit the `yggdrasil.conf` file to add or remove peers, modify
other configuration such as listen addresses or multicast addresses, etc.

### Run Yggdrasil

To run with the generated static configuration:
```
./yggdrasil -useconffile /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

To run in auto-configuration mode (which will use sane defaults and random keys
at each startup, instead of using a static configuration file):

```
./yggdrasil -autoconf
```

You will likely need to run Yggdrasil as a privileged user or under `sudo`,
unless you have permission to create TUN/TAP adapters. On Linux this can be done
by giving the Yggdrasil binary the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
